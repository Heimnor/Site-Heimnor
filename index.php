					Hey bonjour

					"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms
					 of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and
					  equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinkin
						g from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
						 untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
						 pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequen
						 tly occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matt
						 ers to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
						 avoid worse pains."
